Hey, you! I'm Rafael, a full-stack developer from Brazil with 7 years of experience and a bachelor's degree in Information Systems. You may say that I'm fluent in React, Node.js, Next.js, and AWS, but what really gets me going would be the feeling of learning something new—particularly when that means getting into the most recent tech and testing my own limits.

I'm not just about writing code; rather, it's about tastering ideas from all domains and blending them to make something new and user-friendly. If you're into that too, team up! Whether it is getting down to business and talking tech, engaging in a brainstorming session for the next big thing, or maybe just sharing a good laugh over the latest developer meme, I'm all in.
