Why did I create a blog? Well, after years of coding, problem-solving, and occasionally pulling my hair out over one stubborn bug, it dawned on me that I have so much to share-not just the successes but also the headaches.
But it's not all about knowledge sharing.
This blog can also be used as my personal log for everything I have done.
You can call it a second brain, a personal diary, or a collection of my thoughts.
It is like my own diary of technology, reminding me of what worked, what did not, and how I should do it better in the future.
Hopefully, it will also be useful for others who are interested in the same topics.

The first thing I want to share is a new book that I've bought.
Feel-Good Productivity: How to Do More of What Matters to You by Ali Abdaal.
The book combines science-backed research with personal stories to provide practical strategies for readers to improve their work-life balance and feel happier and more fulfilled.
I think that's exactly what I (and probably you) need. Have a good balance between work and life is essential for our mental health and productivity.
